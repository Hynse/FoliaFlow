FoliaFlow is a Minecraft plugin that allows players to using gravity block duplication glitch again in Paper and Folia

## How is work?
Whenever a falling sand entity comes close to or hits the end portal, a new falling sand entity is summoned with a velocity that shoots it straight into the portal. However, we encountered a problem when the entity got reset by the safe teleport Paper patch - it lose its velocity. To fix this, we added the velocity back when the entity was in the end.
